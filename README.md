# BasicCalculator
Calculator App

To access the Calculator, `src/calculator/Calculator`

From there you can use to **add, subtract, multiply, and/or divide**. 

I also added Unit testing to cover all the edge cases that I can think of `test/java/basicCalculator/CalculatorTest`

**I Hope you enjoy using this, and please feel free to comment on what I can improve on!!**
